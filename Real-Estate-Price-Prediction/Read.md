# Real estate price prediction

### Housing Price Prediction

At first glance, this task seemed too obvious to me. When I saw it on Kaggle, I thought: **"What could be so difficult? If a house is in a good neighborhood, has a large area, modern renovation, and convenient infrastructure — it will be expensive. Otherwise, the price will be low."**

But, as is often the case, things are not as simple as they seem.

In reality, you can find two similar houses — with the same size, location, and condition — but with dramatically different prices. The reasons are not always clear. Once I began exploring the data, I discovered that even features like the presence of a garage or the number of bathrooms can significantly impact the final price.

These seemingly small details not only help build more accurate prediction models but also provide valuable insights. For example:

- Investors can identify undervalued properties;

- Agencies can better understand their clients' needs;

- Buyers can choose the best time to purchase a home.

So, this seemingly simple topic opens up wide possibilities for people with different goals.

To support the points mentioned above, all analytics, visualizations, and predictive models can be found in this project.
