# Customer segmentation
At first glance, customer segmentation may seem obvious: different age groups, income levels, genders - it's all clear. But in reality, everything is much deeper.

People come to the mall for different purposes: someone just wants to spend time, someone wants to shop, someone wants to go to the gym or the movies. It's convenient when it's all in one place. For example, a person might say: “I go to the movies every week - why not buy new jeans at the same time?” This is how shopping centers increase traffic and stores increase profits.

And when stores are satisfied, they stay in the center, rent more space and provide stability for the owner. But to maintain this balance, you need to analyze customer behavior. Competitors do not stand still, and success depends on how well you understand your audience.

That's why segmentation is not just about age or gender. It is a way to see who needs special offers, who should be offered premium brands, and who should be rewarded with discounts.
