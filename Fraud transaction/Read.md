# Fraud detection

Cashless payments have become commonplace in the modern world. Every day, more and more people are abandoning cash in favor of bank cards or mobile applications, which makes everyday life much easier.

However, this convenience also has a downside - an increase in the number of fraudulent transactions. Criminals are constantly coming up with new ways to steal money, which is why financial institutions are increasingly implementing technologies to detect suspicious transactions.

This project aims to create a model for detecting fraudulent transactions that will allow companies to respond quickly and effectively to threats, increasing customer security.
  
## Goal
Detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning models.

## Project Description
Transaction analysis and building classification models to detect anomalies in financial transactions.

## Data
Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud): Credit Card Fraud Detection.

## Methods used

- Data analysis (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

- Model building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN)

- Class balancing (SMOTE), cross-validation

- Model evaluation (Recall, ROC AUC Score)
